# MobiLoc
MobiLoc is a neural network-based approach to enhance localization accuracy in mobile scenarios. Our method leverages CFR and the angular spectrum for assistance to determine the positions. We first analyze the feasibility of classifying sensing data into different qualities. Then we implement a neural network architecture specifically designed to identify the sensing data with high quality. The effectiveness of our approach is demonstrated through comprehensive experiments conducted on COTS mmWave communication devices. Results show that MobiLoc can increase the localization accuracy significantly and reduce the median angle estimation error of mobile devices to 1.33â—¦ with only single items of CFR measurements.
